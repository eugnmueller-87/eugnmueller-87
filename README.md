## 🔧 ICARUS Self-Healing System

ICARUS can diagnose and fix its own runtime errors without manual intervention.

**How it works:**

1. Any unhandled exception in a message handler is caught automatically
2. uto_debug.py extracts the traceback and identifies the failing source file
3. Claude Sonnet reads the broken file + full traceback and generates a corrected version
4. The fix is committed directly to the Railway-connected GitHub repo via the GitHub API
5. Railway detects the push and redeploys automatically (~90s)
6. On next startup, ICARUS checks a Redis flag and sends a Telegram report:
   *"Back online after auto-fix. Fixed: bot/claude_router.py: KeyError 'summary'"*
7. If the same file fails twice, it escalates: *"auto-fix exhausted — manual fix needed"*

**Stack:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 GitHub Contents API Upstash Redis Railway auto-deploy
